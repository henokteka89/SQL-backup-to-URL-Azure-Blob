-------
a) Backup to local disk, possibly followed by AzCopy to large block blobs 
b) Backup to Azure Files,
c) Move the database files to Azure Files   

Option c) is the most expensive. It includes copying of 64 TB of data from 5 replicas into new location (Azure share) with unknown performance benefits. We have decided that this approach is the most expensive.
Option a) may contribute to overall IOPS limit per VM, requires provisioning of large chunk of Premium storage.
Option b) was chosen as the least expensive and the most effective. It does not require changes in VM configuration
